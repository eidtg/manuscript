## A Quarto Manuscript Template

This is a template repo for generating a scientific manuscript from Quarto. It was originally adapted from the [Quarto Manuscripts tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/vscode.html), based on the ['quarto-preprint' extension, from Matti Vuorre,](https://github.com/mvuorre/quarto-preprint) and the ['typst-starter-journal-article' repo, from Yigong Hu,](https://github.com/HPDell/typst-starter-journal-article/tree/main) to render the document not only as HTML, but also as PDF using [Typst](https://typst.app/).
